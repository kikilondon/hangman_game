# Hangman-game
This is a digital version of the hangman game, built with React. The player has a wide range of words to guess, pulled from a digital dictionary.
<br>

### How to Play:

• The aim of this game is to guess the hidden word before the hangman's drawing is completed <br>
• You have a limit of 10 attempts to guess the word<br>
• To enter a letter, click on the keyboard below<br>
• Blank spaces represent number of letters in the hidden word<br>
• Hidden words do not include punctuation and numbers<br>
• If your guess is correct, the letter will be added to the hidden word <br>
• If your attempt is incorrect, a part of the hangman will be drawn and you will lose a chance<br>
• You lose when you reach 10 attempts and do not guess the word<br>
• Click 'Reset' to restart the game<br>
